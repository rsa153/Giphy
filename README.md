# Giphy

### About
The GIPHY API was used to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of animals of your choice when you click on a button with the name of the animal. Feel free to add more animals!

### Application Overview
When the user clicks on a button with name of an animal, non-animated gif images appear from the GIPHY API and are placed on the page. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gifs will animate. If the user clicks on the GIPHY image again, the image will no longer animate. A user can add additional and view animal GIPHY images by submitting additional animal names any clicking on the animal name button once the button is generated.
