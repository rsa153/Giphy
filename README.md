# Giphy

##About
The GIPHY API was used to make a dynamic web page that populates gifs relating to the names of the animal buttons that is pressed by the user. When the user selects an animal button, the web page displays 10 non-animated gifs from the GIPHY APIs (and their respective ratings) and places them on the page. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gifs will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, then the gif will no longer be animated. There is also a form on the page that allows users to add additional animal buttons that they can select to view more gifs/ratings.
